## About me
I started studying frontend development in 2024 after a long time choosing between different fields in IT. I spend a lot of time on education and my own development, because frontend development is something that really brings me pleasure. Each solved task makes me a strong specialist step by step. And my task is to direct my zeal in a useful direction for the company I'm going to work for.


I am able to work in a team and actively participate in discussions on improving development processes. My experience includes the creation of educational adaptive web applications and independent projects, which you can find in my profile on [GitHub](https://github.com/dashaleskina) 

I have strong analytical skills and attention to detail, which allows me to effectively solve problems and achieve my goals. I am ready for new challenges and strive to contribute to successful projects.
